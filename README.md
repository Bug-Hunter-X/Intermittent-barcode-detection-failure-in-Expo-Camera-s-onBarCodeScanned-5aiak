# Intermittent Barcode Detection Failure in Expo Camera

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using Expo's Camera component with barcode scanning. The `onBarCodeScanned` function sporadically fails to detect barcodes, even when they are clearly visible within the camera's view.  This issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce consistently.

## Bug Description

The `onBarCodeScanned` callback provided to Expo's Camera component does not always fire when a barcode is scanned.  The barcode is detected by the camera, visually shown to be in focus, yet no callback is triggered.  This problem is not linked to any specific barcode type or configuration, and appears randomly across different devices and testing sessions.

## Reproduction

Reproducing this bug consistently is challenging.  The issue manifests intermittently.  It has been observed across various iOS and Android devices.  There is no clear pattern regarding when the bug appears or disappears.

## Potential Causes

While the root cause remains unclear, potential contributing factors may include:

* **Underlying Camera Hardware/Software Issues:**  Potential conflicts with specific device camera implementations.
* **Timing/Concurrency Problems:** Race conditions or unexpected event ordering may prevent the callback from firing.
* **Expo Internal Issues:**  A possible bug within Expo's Camera API itself.

## Workaround (Partial)

No guaranteed fix currently exists.  However, some users have reported success using a combination of these techniques (these are not guaranteed to resolve the issue):

1. **Increasing Camera Scan Frequency:** This may help to slightly increase the likelihood of detection but has a performance impact.
2. **Re-rendering the Camera Component:**  Forcing a re-render could potentially resolve race conditions, although not highly effective.
3. **Additional Barcode Scanning Library:** Consider implementing a separate, dedicated barcode scanner library and using that alongside or in place of Expo's Camera functionalities.

This repository offers a sample implementation to illustrate the problem and a proposed (but not necessarily definitive) workaround.
