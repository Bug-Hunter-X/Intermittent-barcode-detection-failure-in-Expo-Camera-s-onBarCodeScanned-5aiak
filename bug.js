This bug occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The issue is that the `onBarCodeScanned` function might not be called consistently or at all, leading to unexpected behavior where barcodes are not detected even when they are clearly in view. This seems to be intermittent, and sometimes works seemingly without issue, only to fail without apparent change in code or conditions. This behavior is not easily reproducible on demand, adding to the difficulty of debugging.
